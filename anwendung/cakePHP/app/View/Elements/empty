# Call elements with:
echo $this->element(nameOfElement, array("var" => "set value"));

# Access variable $var in nameOfElement.ctp with $var. It is already initialized with this call scheme above

# Content of nameOfElement.ctp:
# just write normal code inside it, for example:
<?php
echo "I AM AN ELEMENT!";
# It is handled like include(); in php
