  9.2    <u>Reporting</u>.  You must implement those
  reporting mechanisms that Google has set forth and may
  update from time to time in these Terms and in the <a id="tmr0" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/basics#SpecifyingSensor" title="Maps APIs Documentation" target="_top">Maps APIs Documentation</a>.
  For example, as specified
  in the Maps API Documentation, you agree to provide reports to Google
  if your Maps API Implementation enables a device to detect its own
  location through use of a sensor (including but not limited to GPS,
  cell triangulation, WiFi or similar functionality) to display the
  location of the device on a map or to calculate a route.<br>

            the Maps API(s), including but not limited to personally
            identifiable information (such as user names) or
            non-personally identifiable usage information (such as
            location), your privacy policy must describe your use and
            retention of this information.<br><br>
            (ii) Your privacy policy must notify users that you are using
            the Maps API(s) and incorporate by reference the Google

  <b>10.    License Restrictions.</b> Except as expressly permitted under
  the Terms, or unless you have received prior written authorization from
  Google (or, as applicable, from the provider of particular Content),
  Google's licenses above are subject to your adherence to all of the
  restrictions below.
  <br><br>
  <a id="section_10_1"></a>
  10.1    <u>Restrictions on How You May Use the Maps API(s).</u> Except
  as explicitly permitted in Section 8 (Licenses from Google to You) or
  the Maps APIs Documentation, you must not (nor may you permit anyone
  else to) do any of the following:<br><br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  10.1.1. <u>General Restrictions.</u>
  <br>
       <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
       (a) <u>No Access to Maps API(s) except through the Service.</u> You must
       not access or use the Maps API(s) or any Content through any
       technology or means other than those provided in the Service, or
       through other explicitly authorized means Google may designate.
       For example, you must not access map tiles or imagery through
       interfaces or channels (including undocumented Google interfaces)
       other than the Maps API(s).<br><br>
       (b) <u>No Hiding of Identity.</u> You must not hide or mask from Google
       the identity of your Maps API Implementation as it uses the Service, including by
       failing to follow the identification conventions listed in the
       Maps APIs Documentation.<br><br>
       (c) <u>No Reverse Engineering.</u> You must not attempt to reverse
       engineer or decompile the Services or any component, or attempt to
       create a substitute or similar service through use of or access to
       the Services, unless this is expressly permitted or required by
       applicable law. <br><br>
       (d) <u>No Modification of Search Results.</u> You must not modify,
       reorder, augment or manipulate search results in any way unless
       you indicate to the user that this has occurred.<br><br>
       (e) <u>No Modification of Links.</u> You must not modify, replace,
       obscure, or otherwise hinder the functioning of links to Google
       or third party websites provided in the Content.  For the
       avoidance of doubt, titles for place results must link to the
       applicable URL provided in the result, unless the title is intended
       to be selected only for purposes of navigation by an end user
       accessing your Maps API Implementation from a device with
       appropriately space-constraining user interface options. In these
       cases, the title linking to the Google-provided URL must be
       displayed as the top and primary link on the subsequent landing
       page or user interface component.<br><br>
       (f) <u>No Violation of Google Policies.</u> You must not violate any
       policies in the Maps APIs Documentation or violate Google's
       Software Principles (available at

           or other legal justification to use such content;<br><br>
           (iv) upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available messages

           (vi) download any file posted by another that you know, or
           reasonably should know, cannot legally be distributed in
           such manner;<br><br>
           (vii) impersonate another person or entity, or falsify or delete
           any author attributions or labels of the origin or source of
           Content, or other material;<br><br>
           (viii) restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying
           the Service or any other Google Services;<br><br>
           (ix) delete, obscure, or fail to display the Terms of Use link
           as presented through the Service or described in the Maps
           APIs Documentation;<br><br>
           (x) delete, obscure, or in any manner alter any brand features,

           or other proprietary rights notices), or links that appear in the
           Service or the Content;<br><br>
           (xi) interfere with or disrupt the Google Services, servers, or
           networks connected to the Google Services, or disobey any
           requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of networks
           connected to the Google Services;<br><br>
           (xii) use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application,
           or other device to retrieve or index any portion of the Google
           Services or Content or collect information about users for any
           unauthorized purpose;<br><br>
           (xiii) display content in your Maps API Implementation that
           falsely expresses or implies that such content is sponsored or
           endorsed by Google;<br><br>
           (xiv) create user accounts by automated means or under false or
           fraudulent pretenses, or obtain or attempt to obtain multiple
           keys for the same URL;<br><br>
           (xv) promote or provide instructional information about
           illegal activities;<br><br>
           (xvi) promote physical harm or injury against any group or
           individual; or<br><br>
           (xvii) transmit any malicious code (including but not limited to
           viruses, worms, defects, and Trojan horses),
           or any other items of a destructive nature.<br><br>
           </div>
       (g) <u>No Use of Content without a Google Map.</u> You must not use or
       display the Content without a corresponding Google map, unless you
       are explicitly permitted to do so in the Maps APIs Documentation,
       or through written permission from Google.  In any event, you must not
       use or display the Content on or in conjunction with a non-Google map.
       For example, you must not use geocodes obtained through the Service in
       conjunction with a non-Google map.  As another example, you must not
       display Street View imagery alongside a non-Google map, but you may
       display Street View imagery without
       a corresponding Google map because the Maps APIs Documentation
       explicitly permits you to do so.<br><br>
       (h) <u>No Use of Static Maps API(s) outside a Web-Based Application
       (Except with a Link to Google Maps).</u> You must not use the Static
       Maps API(s) outside of a web-based application unless:<br><br>
           <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
           (i) your platform does not have a web browser; or<br><br>
           (ii) if your platform does have a web browser, you provide a
           link that shows the location concerned either (x) in the Google
           Maps native application (if your platform has one); or (y)
           on the Google Maps website.<br><br>
           </div>
       (i) <u>No Use Beyond Google's Transaction Limits and Usage Policies.</u>
       If your Maps API application generates a high volume of transactions,
       Google reserves the right to set transaction limits, as described
       in the Documentation
       <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#usagelimits">here</a>.
       Google also reserves the right to set other
       usage policies in the Documentation from time to time.  If you
       want to engage in use outside these transaction limits or usage
       policies, please contact the Google Maps API for Business sales team for
       information on licensing options to address your needs.<br><br>
       (j) <u>Geolocation Privacy.</u><br><br>
           <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
           (i) Your Maps API Implementation must notify the user in advance of
           the type(s) of data that you intend to collect from the user or the
           user's device.  Your Maps API Implementation must not obtain or cache
           any user's location in any manner except with the user's prior consent.
           Your Maps API Implementation must let the user revoke the user's consent
           at any time.<br><br>
           (ii) If your Maps API Implementation provides Google with geolocation
           data, that geolocation data must not enable Google to identify an
           individual user.  For example, if your Maps API Implementation sends
           Google Your Content, and Your Content includes geolocation data, Your
           Content must not also include unique device identifiers associated with
           individual users.<br><br>
           (iii) If you intend to obtain the user's location and use it with any
           other data provider's data, you must disclose this fact to the user.<br><br>
           </div>
       </div>
  <a id="section_10_1_2"></a>
  <br> 10.1.2 <u>Restrictions against Commercial Use.</u><br><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      (a) <u>No Fees.</u> You must not charge users or any other third party
      any fee for the use of the Maps API Implementation, the Service, or
      the Content, except as permitted under Section 9.1.2 (Exceptions).<br><br>
      (b) <u>No Direct Marketing.</u> You must not print more than 5,000 copies
      of sales collateral materials containing a screenshot of the Content
      for purposes of commercial sales lead generation ("<b>Direct Marketing</b>")
      or incorporate the Content as a core part of printed matter (such as
      printed maps or guide books) that you redistribute for a fee. You must
      contact the
      <a href="http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/bin/request.py?contact_type=gme&utm_campaign=en-us-codeterms">
      Google Maps API for Business sales team</a> to obtain a direct license
      if you desire to do either of the above.
      </div>
  <a id="section_10_1_3"></a>
  <br><br> 10.1.3 <u>Restrictions against Data Export or Copying.</u><br><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      (a) <u>No Unauthorized Copying, Modification, Creation of Derivative
      Works, or Display of the Content.</u> You must not copy, translate,
      modify, or create a derivative work (including creating or
      contributing to a database) of, or publicly display any Content or
      any part thereof except as explicitly permitted under these Terms.
      For example, the following are prohibited: (i) creating server-side
      modification of map tiles; (ii) stitching multiple static map images
      together to display a map that is larger than permitted in the
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/">Maps
      APIs Documentation</a>; (iii) creating mailing lists or telemarketing
      lists based on the Content; or (iv) exporting, writing, or saving
      the Content to a third party's location-based platform or service.<br><br>
      (b) <u>No Pre-Fetching, Caching, or Storage of Content.</u> You must not
      pre-fetch, cache, or store any Content, except that you may store:
      (i) limited amounts of Content for the purpose of improving the
      performance of your Maps API Implementation if you do so temporarily
      (and in no event for more than 30 calendar days),
      securely, and in a manner that does not permit use of the Content
      outside of the Service; and (ii) any content identifier or key that
      the Maps APIs Documentation specifically permits you to store. For
      example, you must not use the Content to create an independent
      database of "places" or other local listings information.<br><br>
      (c) <u>No Mass Downloads or Bulk Feeds of Content.</u> You must not use
      the Service in a manner that gives you or any other person access
      to mass downloads or bulk feeds of any Content, including but not
      limited to numerical latitude or longitude coordinates, imagery,
      visible map data, or places data (including business listings).
      For example, you are not permitted to offer a batch geocoding
      service that uses Content contained in the Maps API(s).
      </div>
  <a id="section_10_2"></a>
  <br><br> 10.2 <u>Restrictions on the Types of Applications that You are
  Permitted to Build with the Maps API(s).</u> Except as explicitly permitted
  in Section 8 (Licenses from Google to You) or the Maps APIs Documentation,
  you must not (nor may you permit anyone else to) do any of the following:<br><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      (a) <u>No "Wrapping."</u> You must not create or offer a "wrapper" for the
      Service, unless you obtain Google's written consent to do so. For example,
      you are not permitted to: (i) use or provide any part of the Service
      or Content (such as map imagery, geocoding, directions, places, or
      terrain data) in an API that you offer to others; or (ii) create a
      Maps API Implementation that reimplements or duplicates Google Maps/Google Earth.
      For clarity, you are not "re-implementing or duplicating" Google Maps/Google Earth if your Maps API
      Implementation provides substantial additional features or content
      beyond Google Maps/Google Earth, and those additional features or content constitute
      the primary defining characteristic of your Maps API Implementation.<br><br>
      (b) <u>No Business, Residential, or Telephone Listings Services.</u> You must
      not display any of the business listings Content provided by
      the Maps API(s) in any Maps API Implementation
      that has the primary purpose of making available business, residential
      address, or telephone directory listings.<br><br>
      (c) <u>No Navigation, Autonomous Vehicle Control, or Enterprise
      Applications.</u> You must not use the Service or Content with any products,
      systems, or applications for or in connection with any of the following:<br><br>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
          (i) real time navigation or route guidance, including but not limited
          to turn-by-turn route guidance that is synchronized to the position
          of a user's sensor-enabled device.<br><br>
          (ii) any systems or functions for automatic or autonomous control
          of vehicle behavior; or<br><br>
          (iii) enterprise dispatch, fleet management, business asset tracking
          or similar applications.
          If you want to engage in enterprise dispatch, fleet management,
          business asset tracking, or similar applications, please contact
          the

          use the Google Maps API(s) to track assets such as cars, buses
          or other vehicles, as long as your tracking application is made
          available to the public without charge.  For example, you may

  <b>15.    Indemnities.</b><br>
  <br> 15.1    You hereby agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Google, its
  officers, directors, agents, affiliates, strategic partners, licensors
  and their suppliers ("<b>the Indemnified Parties</b>") harmless from and
  against any claim or liability arising out of:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
             (a) your use of the Maps API(s) in breach of the Terms or
             applicable policies;<br> (b) your Maps API Implementation;<br>
             (c) any use by users of your Maps API Implementation;<br> (d)
             any claim that your Maps API Implementation or Your Content
             violates any applicable law, including but not limited to any
             claim that your Maps API Implementation infringes the rights
             of a third party. <br>
</div>
  <br> 15.2    You will cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the
  defense of any claim.  Google reserves the right, at its own expense,
  to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to
  indemnification by you.  You acknowledge that damages for improper use of
  the Maps API(s) may be irreparable; therefore, Google is entitled to seek
  equitable relief, including but not limited to preliminary injunction
  and injunction, in addition to all other remedies.
  <br> <br>
  <b>16. Copyright Policies; Content Removal; Termination of
  Repeat Offenders' Accounts.</b>
  <br> <br> It is Google's policy to respond to
  notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable
  international intellectual property law (including, in the United States,
  the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and to terminate the accounts of
  repeat offenders.  Details of Google's policy can be found <a title="here" href="http://www.google.com/dmca.html" id="y7:c" target="_top">here</a>.<br> <br>
  <b>17. Other Content</b>.<br> <br>
  17.1 The Service may include hyperlinks to
  other websites or content or resources.  Google has no control over any
  web sites or resources that are provided by companies or persons other
  than Google.  You acknowledge and agree that Google is not responsible
  for the availability of any such external sites or resources, and does not
  endorse any advertising, products, or other materials on or available from
  such websites or resources.<br> <br>
  17.2    You acknowledge and agree
  that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that may be incurred by
  you as a result of the availability of those external sites or resources,
  or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy,
  or existence of any advertising, products, or other materials on, or
  available from, such websites or resources.<br> <br>
  <b>18. Language of the Terms.<br> <br> </b>
  18.1    Where Google has provided you with a
  translation of the English language version of the Terms, you agree that
  the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English
  language version of the Terms will govern your relationship with Google.<br>
  <br>
  18.2 If there is any contradiction between the English language
  version of the Terms and a translation of the Terms, the English language
  version will take precedence.<br> <br>
  <b>19.    General Legal Terms.<br>
  <br> </b>
  19.1 <u>Notices</u>.  You agree that Google may provide you
  with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email,
  regular mail, or postings on the Service.<br> <br>
  19.2 <u>No Waiver</u>.
  You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or
  remedy available to it under the Terms (or any applicable law), Google will
  not be deemed to have waived its rights or remedies, and those rights
  and remedies will still be available to Google.  Any waiver of any
  provision of these Terms will be effective
  only if Google expressly states in a signed writing that it is waiving a
  specified Term.<br> <br>
  19.3 <u>Severability</u>.  If any court of law
  that has jurisdiction rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid,
  then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the
  rest of the Terms.  The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to
  be valid and enforceable.<br> <br>
  19.4    <u>Third Party Beneficiaries</u>.
  You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
  Google is the parent, and each of the Indemnified Parties, will be third party
  beneficiaries to the Terms and that
  such other companies will be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon,
  any provision of the Terms that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor
  of) them.  Other than this, no other person or company will be a third party
  beneficiary to the Terms.<br> <br>
  19.5    <u>Assignment</u>.  The Terms
  may be assigned by Google and will inure to the benefit of Google, its
  successors, and assigns.<br> <br>
  19.6    <u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction;
  Injunctive Relief</u>.  The Terms, and your relationship with Google under
  the Terms, are governed by the laws of the State of California, USA,
  without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  You and Google agree to
  submit to the exclusive, personal jurisdiction of the federal or state
  courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, to resolve any
  legal matter arising from or related to
  the Terms.  Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google will be allowed
  to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
  relief) in any jurisdiction.<br> <br>
  19.7    <u>Complete Agreement</u>.
  These Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Google
  in connection with, and govern your use of, the Service and Content. These
  Terms completely replace and
  supersede any prior agreements between you and Google, written or oral,
  in connection with the Service and Content.<br> <br> <br>
